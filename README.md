# Product Description:

## Trade Assistant GS MT5

The Trade Assistant GS MT5 is a forex robot designed to assist traders in making profitable trades in the forex market. Developed by an unknown developer, this robot utilizes a trend analysis algorithm to determine the market trend and place buy or sell orders accordingly.

The main trend analysis function, AnalyzeTrend(), uses the 'Gold Stuff' indicator with user-defined inputs such as period, moving average method, and applied price. It calculates the main trend based on these inputs and checks if it is bullish or bearish.

If the main trend is bullish, the robot places a buy order using the OrderSend() function with a lot size of 0.01 and the current Ask price. The order is labeled as a 'Buy Order' and colored in green.

If the main trend is bearish, the robot places a sell order using the OrderSend() function with a lot size of 0.01 and the current Bid price. The order is labeled as a 'Sell Order' and colored in red.

If the main trend is not determined, the function returns false and no order is placed. 

The PlaceOrder() function is used to place buy or sell orders based on the order type provided as an argument. It checks the order type and uses the OrderSend() function to place the corresponding order.

In the main program, OnStart(), the trend is analyzed using the AnalyzeTrend() function. If the trend analysis is successful, a buy order is placed with a lot size of 0.01 and buy order type. If the trend analysis fails, a sell order is placed with the same lot size and sell order type.
